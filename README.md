#### Run with docker
- Run `docker build -t flask/production-app .`
- Run `docker run -p 5000:5000 flask/production-app`

#### Run locally
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the project root
- Run `./gunicorn_init.sh` or `python3 app.py`
- Navigate to `0.0.0.0:5000/guest`, `0.0.0.0:5000/window`. Replace the `0.0.0.0` IP with your own for other devices
- An SSL certificate is required, so if you don't provide a cert, nor are running this on a reverse proxy that has one, then you should enable settings on your browser to allow HTTP video transmission. Example for Google Chrome provided [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58172025)

## Misc Notes


#### MediaStreamTrack = what you use to receive frames when someone clicks start on the website, a RTC peer connection is created. 
On that connection there is smth called getReceivers which gives you a list of receivers


#### windowoffer & guestOffer
Whenever start button clicked, a request is sent here -> yo I want to make a connection -> establishes a peer connection
Peer Connection = large wrapper for everything
RTCPeerConnections.getReceivers() -> gets you the list of receivers that the peer connection has.
    - store peerConnection in dictionary(guest, peerConnection)
    - we want the tracks (MediaStreamTrack = str and coroutine that you can call to get the frame) which we can access from the receivers


#### on_track
basically transforms the track into a transformed  track -> modify the track how we want it to toss it back to the client (window or guest)


RTCPeerConnection.getReceivers()
loop through the list received
  RTCRtpReceiver.track to access the track from a peer conection
